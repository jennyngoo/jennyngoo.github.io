<h1> About me </h1>
<br><br>
<p> 
I am a UCSD alumni with a B.S. in Math-Computer Science. 
I dabble a lot in graphic design, photography, and video-editing. 
I have a passion for helping people so ultimately my goal in life is to
somehow combine all these tools and create something to help some one in some
way.
In my free time, I like to play pump it up (somewhat competetively),
league of legends (I know.. what the heck), fort nite (building is the best),
and I also really like to travel and be outdoors.
